# Creating Skills

## What is a Skill?

A **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.

**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides

**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once

## When to Create a Skill

**Create when:**
- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you
- You'd reference this again across projects
- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)
- Others would benefit

**Don't create for:**
- One-off solutions
- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere
- Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md)

## Skill Types

### Technique
Concrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)

### Pattern
Way of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)

### Reference
API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)

All use same structure - type in frontmatter for context, not organization.

## Directory Structure

```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)
    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed
```

**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable location

**Separate files for:**
1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax
2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates

**Keep inline:**
- Principles and concepts
- Code patterns (< 50 lines)
- Everything else

## SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: Human-Readable Name
description: One-line summary of what this does
when_to_use: Symptoms and situations when you need this (CSO-critical)
version: 1.0.0
languages: all | [typescript, python] | etc
type: technique | pattern | reference
dependencies: (optional) Required tools/libraries

```

## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)

**Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill

### 1. Rich when_to_use

Include SYMPTOMS not just abstract use cases:

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Too abstract
when_to_use: For async testing

# ✅ GOOD: Symptoms and context
when_to_use: When tests use setTimeout/sleep and are flaky, timing-dependent,
  pass locally but fail in CI, or timeout when run in parallel
```

### 2. Keyword Coverage

Use words Claude would search for:
- Error messages: "Hook timed out", "ENOTEMPTY", "race condition"
- Symptoms: "flaky", "hanging", "zombie", "pollution"
- Synonyms: "timeout/hang/freeze", "cleanup/teardown/afterEach"
- Tools: Actual commands, library names, file types

### 3. Descriptive Naming

**Use active voice, verb-first:**
- ✅ `creating-skills` not `skill-creation`
- ✅ `testing-skills-with-subagents` not `subagent-skill-testing`
- ✅ `using-skills` not `skill-usage`

**Name by what you DO or core insight:**
- ✅ `condition-based-waiting` > `async-test-helpers`
- ✅ `flatten-with-flags` > `data-structure-refactoring`
- ✅ `root-cause-tracing` > `debugging-techniques`

**Gerunds (-ing) work well for processes:**
- `creating-skills`, `testing-skills`, `debugging-with-logs`
- Active, describes the action you're taking

### 4. Content Repetition

Mention key concepts multiple times:
- In description
- In when_to_use
- In overview
- In section headers

Grep hits from multiple places = easier discovery

## Flowchart Usage

```dot
digraph when_flowchart {
    "Need to show information?" [shape=diamond];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use markdown" [shape=box];
    "Small inline flowchart" [shape=box];

    "Need to show information?" -> "Decision where I might go wrong?" [label="yes"];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" -> "Small inline flowchart" [label="yes"];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" -> "Use markdown" [label="no"];
}
```

**Use flowcharts ONLY for:**
- Non-obvious decision points
- Process loops where you might stop too early
- "When to use A vs B" decisions

**Never use flowcharts for:**
- Reference material → Tables, lists
- Code examples → Markdown blocks
- Linear instructions → Numbered lists
- Labels without semantic meaning (step1, helper2)

See @graphviz-conventions.dot for graphviz style rules.

## Code Examples

**One excellent example beats many mediocre ones**

Choose most relevant language:
- Testing techniques → TypeScript/JavaScript
- System debugging → Shell/Python
- Data processing → Python

**Good example:**
- Complete and runnable
- Well-commented explaining WHY
- From real scenario
- Shows pattern clearly
- Ready to adapt (not generic template)

**Don't:**
- Implement in 5+ languages
- Create fill-in-the-blank templates
- Write contrived examples

You're good at porting - one great example is enough.

## File Organization

### Self-Contained Skill
```
defense-in-depth/
  SKILL.md    # Everything inline
```
When: All content fits, no heavy reference needed

### Skill with Reusable Tool
```
condition-based-waiting/
  SKILL.md    # Overview + patterns
  example.ts  # Working helpers to adapt
```
When: Tool is reusable code, not just narrative

### Skill with Heavy Reference
```
pptx/
  SKILL.md       # Overview + workflows
  pptxgenjs.md   # 600 lines API reference
  ooxml.md       # 500 lines XML structure
  scripts/       # Executable tools
```
When: Reference material too large for inline

## Bulletproofing Skills Against Rationalization

Skills that enforce discipline (like TDD) need to resist rationalization. Agents are smart and will find loopholes when under pressure.

### Close Every Loophole Explicitly

Don't just state the rule - forbid specific workarounds:

<Bad>
```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it.
```
</Bad>

<Good>
```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete
```
</Good>

### Address "Spirit vs Letter" Arguments

Add foundational principle early:

```markdown
**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**
```

This cuts off entire class of "I'm following the spirit" rationalizations.

### Build Rationalization Table

Test the skill (see next section). Every excuse agents make goes in the table:

```markdown
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Tests after achieve same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
```

### Create Red Flags List

Make it easy for agents to self-check when rationalizing:

```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "It's about spirit not ritual"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**
```

### Update CSO for Violation Symptoms

Add to when_to_use: symptoms of when you're ABOUT to violate the rule:

```yaml
when_to_use: Every feature and bugfix. When you wrote code before tests.
  When you're tempted to test after. When manually testing seems faster.
```

## Testing Skills With Subagents

**Don't trust untested skills.** Use subagents to stress-test before deploying.

See @../testing-skills-with-subagents/SKILL.md for complete methodology.

**Quick process:**
1. Write skill with clear rules
2. Test with academic questions (do they understand?)
3. Test with pressure scenarios (do they comply?)
4. Identify rationalizations used
5. Add explicit counters
6. Re-test same scenarios
7. Repeat until bulletproof

**Key insight:** Academic questions test understanding. Pressure scenarios test compliance. You need both.

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Narrative Example
"In session 2025-10-03, we found empty projectDir caused..."
**Why bad:** Too specific, not reusable

### ❌ Multi-Language Dilution
example-js.js, example-py.py, example-go.go
**Why bad:** Mediocre quality, maintenance burden

### ❌ Code in Flowcharts
```dot
step1 [label="import fs"];
step2 [label="read file"];
```
**Why bad:** Can't copy-paste, hard to read

### ❌ Generic Labels
helper1, helper2, step3, pattern4
**Why bad:** Labels should have semantic meaning

## Skill Creation Checklist

**Before writing:**
- [ ] Technique applies broadly (not project-specific)
- [ ] Non-obvious enough to document
- [ ] Would reference this again

**While writing:**
- [ ] Name describes what you DO or core insight
- [ ] YAML frontmatter with rich when_to_use (include symptoms!)
- [ ] Keywords throughout for search (errors, symptoms, tools)
- [ ] Type marked (technique/pattern/reference)
- [ ] Clear overview with core principle
- [ ] Small flowchart only if decision non-obvious
- [ ] Quick reference table
- [ ] Code inline OR @link to separate file
- [ ] Common mistakes section
- [ ] One excellent example (not multi-language)
- [ ] No narrative storytelling
- [ ] Supporting files only for tools or heavy reference

**If skill enforces discipline:**
- [ ] Add foundational principle ("Violating letter is violating spirit")
- [ ] Close loopholes explicitly (no "reference", no "adapt")
- [ ] Build rationalization table (test first)
- [ ] Create red flags list
- [ ] Update when_to_use with violation symptoms
- [ ] Test with subagents (see @../testing-skills-with-subagents/SKILL.md)
- [ ] Iterate until bulletproof

## Discovery Workflow

How future Claude finds your skill:

1. **Encounters problem** ("tests are flaky")
2. **Greps skills** (`grep -r "flaky" ~/.claude/skills/`)
3. **Finds SKILL.md** (rich when_to_use matches)
4. **Scans overview** (is this relevant?)
5. **Reads patterns** (quick reference table)
6. **Loads example** (only when implementing)

**Optimize for this flow** - put searchable terms early and often.
