# When Stuck

## Process

1. **Write down what's not working**
   - Be specific about the symptoms
   - What did you expect vs what happened?

2. **Third attempt failed?**
   - If yes → Stop and say: "I don't understand X"
   - Ask Jesse for help
   - If no → Continue debugging

3. **Remove half the code**
   - Simplify to isolate the problem
   - Binary search for the issue

4. **Add debug output**
   - Log key variables
   - Trace execution flow

5. **Copy working example exactly**
   - Find similar working code
   - Compare line by line

6. **Still stuck?**
   - Log this failed approach to journal
   - Return to step 1 with new perspective
   - Or ask for help

## Remember
- Being stuck after 3 attempts is not failure
- Asking for help is the right move
- Document what didn't work so you learn from it
