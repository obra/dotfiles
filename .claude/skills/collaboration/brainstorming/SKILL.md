# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured questioning and alternative exploration.

**Core principle:** Ask questions to understand, explore alternatives, present design incrementally for validation.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Understanding
- Check current project state in working directory
- Ask ONE question at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice when possible
- Gather: Purpose, constraints, success criteria

### Phase 2: Exploration
- Propose 2-3 different approaches (reference @../../coding/exploring-alternatives/SKILL.md)
- For each: Core architecture, trade-offs, complexity assessment
- Ask Jesse which approach resonates

### Phase 3: Design Presentation
- Present in 200-300 word sections
- Cover: Architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Ask after each section: "Does this look right so far?"

### Phase 4: Handoff
When approved: "Ready to create implementation plan? Run `/write-plan` next."

## Remember
- One question per message during Phase 1
- Apply YAGNI ruthlessly (reference @../../architecture/reducing-complexity/SKILL.md)
- Explore 2-3 alternatives before settling
- Present incrementally, validate as you go
